# About the project

The film industry plays a major role in the planetary or world-wide economy. It is the symbolic contributor to the global economy. Every year more than hundreds to thousands of movies are released to the public with the hope that the movies getting released will be the next blockbuster. According to the movie industry statistics, six to seven movies out of ten are unprofitable, only one third of the movies are successful. The producers, studios, investors, sponsors in the movie industry are alike interested in predicting the box office success of the movie. 
This paperwork is on analyzing the film genre, the release date around holidays, the release month of movies, the languages and country with more movies from the movie review dataset. There are attributes (country, languages, genre, movie release date, budget and revenue) taken from the dataset and the derived attributes (release month of the movie derived from release date of movie and profit from budget and revenue) is analyzed to determine the movie performance. The analyzed data is plotted in graphs for statistical observation of the movie success.
